				 A dozen years ago, back in 2005, the marvels of NITK created a unique platform for the talented and creative minds to get acquainted with the aces of engineering industry. A multitude of students concentrated the technical events and fests organized by the various student clubs into one grand conglomeration and fondly christened it-ENGINEER the Annual Symposium of NITK. Challenging the "impossibility in its purest form‚Äù, the Penrose triangle stands as the icon for the fest, etching within it the maxim, <strong>Think, Create, Engineer.</strong><br/><br/> The 12th edition of Engineer far exceeds its ancestors as the festival emerges to be a nationwide celebration, ranking second among India's technical festivals. Racing its way to the zenith, Engineer has become a kaleidoscope of exhilaration by comprising of flagship events such as Velocity, RoboWar, Tronix Events, Humanoid Robotics, Workshops, flash mobs, online coding events with participating teams from Google and Microsoft, among many such mind racking challenges. This brainchild has seldom failed to capture attention of prodigies all over the globe, and the stage has been enriched with the presence of distinguished speakers like Richard Stallman, Sam Pitrda, Dr Devi Sheet, Sir Anthony James Legett and many more. Engineer has also played host to global organizations such as CERN, MIT Media and Ball Labs. Socially Conscious Engineering is another branch of Engineer and provides a boost to effective innovation and the MBA events are the key to realizing our true potential in the technical bonanza, we have fun filled events like freefall which serve as the pinnacle of attraction. This wonderful fusion of technical skills with boisterous events will definitely dilate the reasoning of innovative minds and help them to showcase their talents on a higher platform, thereby bestowing invaluable help to the progress of the society.
